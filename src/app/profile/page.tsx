          My name is Christopher Dedman-Rollet! I am a computer science student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree.
          I have a strong passion for programming and a deep interest in learning and exploring the field.
          I have experience with several languages, including Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Elixir, and Golang.
          I have also learned the fundamentals of Assembly Language (MASM).
          In addition to my technical skills, I am also a quick learner, a critical thinker, and a problem-solver.
          I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects and to continue growing as a programmer.
          As a student, I have completed several programming-related courses and have consistently received high marks for my work.
          In addition, I have also completed several independent projects, including contributing to open-source projects.
          I am constantly seeking out opportunities to learn and grow, and I am
          looking for internship opportunities that will allow me to gain practical experience in the field.
